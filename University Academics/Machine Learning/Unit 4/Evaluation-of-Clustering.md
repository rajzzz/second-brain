#### Internal Metrics:
- **Shilloutte Score:** Measures how similar an object is to its cluster compared to other clusters.
- **Cohesion and Speration:** Assess intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster seperation.
#### External metrics:
(Requires ground truth labels)
- **[[ARI]] (Adjusted Rand Index):** Compares the agreement between predicted clusters and ground truth
- **Mutual Information:** Measures the shared information between predicted clusters and ground truth.
