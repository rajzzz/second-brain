- Clusterning is an [[Unsupervised-Learning]] tehnique where data is grouped into [[clusters]].

**Objective:** To paritition a dataset into distinct groups based on similarity.

#### Steps:
1. Data Preperation:
2. Feature Selection:
3. Choosing a [[Clustering Method]]
4. Evaluation of Clusters.
5. Interpreting Results
#### Applications:
1. Social Networks: Community Detection
2. Anamoaly Detection
3. Image processing
4. Species or gene detection.
#### Types:
- [[Fuzzy clustering]](Soft Clustering): ([[C-Means]])
- Hard Clustering: ([[K-Means]])
