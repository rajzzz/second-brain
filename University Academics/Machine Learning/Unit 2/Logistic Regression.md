- It is a [[Classification]] algorithm.
- used to model the probability of a binary outcome.
- Predicts the probability using a sigmoid functino:

$$ \Large {P(y = 1|x) = \frac{1}{1+ e^{-(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b)}}}$$
#### Applications:
- Binary Classifications such as spam detection, disease diagnosis etc.
