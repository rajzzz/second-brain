**Support Vector Macines** are powerful [[Supervised Learning]] algorithms used for [[Classification]] and regression.

The idea is to find the optimal decision boundary that best seperates different classes in your data.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Hyperplane:** The decision boundary, line in 2D, plane in 3d and so on
- **Margin:** SVMs aim to find the hyperplane that has the largest possible distance to the nearest data points of each class.
- **Support Vectors:** Data points closest to the hyperplane. They define the orientation of the optimal hyperplane

- Effective in high-Dimensional spaces.
- Memory Efficient
