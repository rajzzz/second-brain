 A technique where multiple [[Machine Learning Model]] are combined to produce a stronger model.
 These aim to reduce bias and variance in individual mdoels.

The main challenge is not to obtain highly accurate base models but to obtain base models that make *different kinds of errors*.

#### Techniques:
- [[Bagging]]
- [[Boosting]]
- [[Stacking]]
- [[Voting]]
