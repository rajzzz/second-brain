each data point can belong to more than one clusters. with a degree of membership ([[Fuzzy Set]]).
#### Fuzzy vs Hard [[Clustering]]

|             | Hard Clustering (e.g., k-means) | Fuzzy Clustering (e.g., Fuzzy C-Means) |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Membership  | 0 or 1                          | Value between 0 and 1                  |
| Belonging   | One cluster only                | Multiple clusters possible             |
| Flexibility | Less                            | More (handles ambiguity better)        |
