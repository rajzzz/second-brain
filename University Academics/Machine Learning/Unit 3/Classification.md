Classification is a type of **[[Supervised Learning]]** where the goal is to predict a categorical label (class) for  given input variables (features).

#### Examples:
- Email → Spam or Not Spam
- Tumor → Malignant or Benign
- Image → Cat, Dog, Bird

#### Types
1. **Binary Classifiaction:** Two possible classes
2. **Multi-Class Classification:** More than two classes
3. **Multi-label Classification:** Each instance may belong to multiple classes simultaneously
#### Classification Algorithms:
1. Linear Classifiers
	- [[Logistic Regression]]
	- [[LDA]] (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
2. Non-Linear Classifiers:
	- [[k-NN]]
	- [[SVM]]
3. Tree-Based Methods:
	- [[Decision Tree]]
	- [[Random Forests]]
	- [[Gradient Boosting]] (XGBoost)
4. Neural Networks:
	- [[MLP]] (Multilayer Perceptrons)
	- Convolutional Neural Networks [[CNN]] (for image data).
5. Bayesian Models:
	- [[Naive Bayes Linear Models]]
