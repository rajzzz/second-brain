## Issues in [[Machine Learning Model]]

* **Data Quality and Quantity:** Insufficient, noisy, or biased data can lead to poor performance.
* **[[Overfitting]] and [[Underfitting]]**
* **[Bias and Fairness](Algorithmic-Bias.md):** 
* Some Complex models (like deep neural networks) are considred black boxes as its difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions.
* **Computational Cost:** Resources and Time.
