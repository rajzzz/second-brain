It refers to a situation where a model produces **systematically prejudiced results** due to incorrect assumptions in the machine learning process. It's about unfairness.

## Example:
Imagine an ML model designed to approve bank loans. If the historical data used to train the model contains fewer loan approvals for women (perhaps due to historical societal biases), the model might learn a pattern that "being a woman" is a feature that predicts loan rejection. This creates a vicious cycle, where the AI perpetuates and even amplifies past injustices.
