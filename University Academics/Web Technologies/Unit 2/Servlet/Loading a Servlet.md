The Servlet container loads the Servlet class into memory.
Also creates an instance of the Servlet using [[no-argument constructor]].

The Servlet can be loaded by the [[Servlet container]]:
either during the initialisation of web app or when Servlet is first requested by client (if [[lazy loading]] is enabled).
