A, B and C are Linearly dependent if C can be written in terms of A and B.

$2A +B = C$

$A + B + C = 0$ can be written as

$A+B+2A+B=0$ 

here A and B would Be Linearly Independent.

## Linear Independence in vector space

Let $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \dots, \vec{v}_n$ be vectors in a [[vector space]] $V$.

**For linear independence**, this equation:

$$
c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \dots + c_n \vec{v}_n = \vec{0}
$$

**requires that all scalars equal zero**:

$$
c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_n = 0
$$
