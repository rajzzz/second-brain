Singular value decomposition(SVD) widely used for dimensionality and noise reduction

Unlike [[Eigen Decomposition]] it can be used for any [[matrix]] not just square.

$A=U \Sigma V^T$ 

1. $U$ is an orthogonal matrix (mxm)
2. $\Sigma$ is a diagonal Matrix containing singular values
3. $V^T$ is the transpose of another orthognal matrix V (nxn)
