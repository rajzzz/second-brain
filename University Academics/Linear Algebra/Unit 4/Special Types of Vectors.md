**1. Zero Vector**: A zero vector is a vector whose components are all zeros. It is commonly denoted simply as 0, regardless of its dimensionality. For example:

**2.** **Unit Vector**: A unit vector is a vector that has a **magnitude of one (I will explain in the following contents)**. An example of a unit vector in R3 could be:

**3.** **[[Sparse Vector]]**: A sparse vector is a vector in which most of the elements are zero. For example, a sparse vector in R5 may look like:

**4.** **Basis Vectors**: In a vector space, basis vectors are linearly independent vectors that span the space. For instance, in R3, the standard basis vectors are:

**5.** **Orthogonal Vectors**: Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero. For example, in R2:

**6**. **Normal Vector**: A normal is an object that is perpendicular to a given object. It is a line or vector that intersects another object at a right angle. A **normal vector** is a vector that is perpendicular to a given surface or curve at a specific point. A **unit normal vector** is a normal vector whose length is **1**.
