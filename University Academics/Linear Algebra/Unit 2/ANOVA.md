# Analysis of Variance

The core Idea is to **analyze the variance** in your data to dermine if the differences between group means are statistically significant or not.

* ANOVA is a technique that partitions the total variation in a set of data into two or more sources of variation
* Specifically it looks at:
	1. [[Between Group Variability]]
	2. [[Within Group Variability]]

The fundamental principle is that if the between-group variability is significantly larger than the within-group variability, then it's likely that at least one of the group means is different from the others.

* **Purposes of ANOVA:**
    * To estimate & test hypotheses about population [[variance]].
    * To estimate & test hypotheses about population [means](mean).

## The ANOVA Procedure

1.  Description of data
2.  Assumptions
3.  Hypotheses
4.  Test Statistic
5.  Distribution of test statistic
6.  Decision rule
7.  Calculations of test statistic
8.  Statistical decision
9.  Conclusion
10. Determination of [[p-Values]].
* The results are summarized in an **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table**.
