* expresses a relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (response) using a [[linear equation]].
* They are widely used in statistical analysis and [[Machine Learning]] due to their interpretability, simplicity, and effectiveness.

* **General Equation for a Linear Model:**
    $$Y_{j}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1j}+\beta_{2}X_{2j}+...++\beta_{k}X_{kj}+\epsilon_{j}$$
    * $Y_j$: Dependent variable
    * $X_{kj}$: Independent variables
    * $\beta_j$: Coefficients in the model
    * $\epsilon_j$: Random error

* Any model representable in this form, with constant coefficients and algebraic order of one, is considered a linear model.
