Measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data points around their [[mean]]. 
It quantifies how much the individual values deviate from the average value of the dataset.

Variance is also Simply square of [[Standard Deviation]]
## [[Population]] Variance ($\sigma^2$):
$$\Large \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2$$
## [[Sample]] Variance ($s^2$):
$$\Large s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$
